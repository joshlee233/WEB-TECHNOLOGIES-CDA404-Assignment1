#Background
###Why did I start this project?
The background behind wanting to create this website was to help digitally brand myself online. This will help give me visibility to prospective customers and to potential employers. It can help to showcase my work and give some insight into my background, how and why I started web design and some information about my work.

The current issue is that I have no way of showing employers or customers projects I have and will work on in my time as a web developer and designer. Having this website will really help me kick start my career and show people what i'm capable of and what i have left to build on. It also provides a way for me to look back at previous projects I've worked on and improve on them or learn from my past.

In this project I have chosen to do a desktop first approach. Although most people visit a website on their mobile device before a desktop, my website is for potential employers or customers looking for a website or someone to hire. Therefore showcasing my work on a desktop is most appropriate for this scenario as it enables for lots of projects to be displayed and more information than usual to be shown.
